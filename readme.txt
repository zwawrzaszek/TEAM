Welcome

Welcome to the project readme for our team, tentatively named...TEAM (TEAM Exists As Metonym)! This will be our "home base" for the CSC 154 documentation project and todo list. I will try to keep most of the key information here because we have such a small group. However, as needed, I will break out some content into other files. 

Keep in mind that this is a public repo so we won't be posting any e-mail addresses, links to our other collaboration tools, etc. We'll have regular group meetings and some [emotion and thought] communication elsewhere but everything of substance should be committed here—even the meeting minutes. By doing the majority of our work in the open on Git, we will not only have better control of versioning but something we can all share in the future on a résumé; I plan to keep this repo open and public indefinitely.

Schedule

===
Week 1 (2020-05-24)

---
Due By *Tuesday* (2020-05-26)

0. Read this readme.
1. Read the readme in the resources directory.
2. Set up Slack.
2.1. Create Slack account and/or join our channel.
2.2. Say hello ASAP, including your name and *GitHub username* so you can get a repo invite!
3. Set up Git.
3.1. Create Git account and/or join this repo as a collaborator.
3.2. Install Git (optional; I use plain Git (it comes with Git GUI and Git Bash) as GitHub Desktop is very so-so and a privacy/update nightmare, though the integration is tighter).
3.3. Fetch repo (optional; if you you wanted, you could theoretically do all edits from GitHub...).
3.4. Fork it (optional; if we're ok on time we may make this a requirement to tighten up the access control and learn more about GitHub).
4. Add your availability so we can schedule a regular Slack meeting (use a Git commit to the availability.txt file—get used to commits!).
5. Pick your role in roles.txt; if you want to switch with someone before Wednesday use Slack or e-mail them to discuss.
6. Add at least 2 ideas—preferably consonant with your role—to pitch_ideas.txt .

---
Due By *Thursday* (2020-05-28)

7. Make at least 1 meaningful edit to the formal pitch.txt .
8. Post at least 1 message in each Slack sub-channel associated with your role's deliverables (eg, lead dev would post in the HLD and LLD channels).
9. Create [deliverable abbreviation]_ideas.txt file in the root directory for each deliverable you are the primary responsible party for (eg, srs_ideas.txt for the customer advocate; note that some of you will not need to create anything); please make sure you use the proper NKMF headers in your text document, use proper UEWSG-style formatting and syntax, and pay attention to the commit messages: they are easy to write from Git GUI or Git Bash and should follow the format I've outlined—if the message doesn't meet the requirements, I will undo your push and you can try the commit/push again (you'll have to rebase).

---
Due By *Saturday* (2020-05-30)

10. Copyedit of final Pitch document (document specialist only; we're still awaiting *substantive* information from the teacher about filetype and other reqs).

Ground Rules

For now, because the group is so small, I am going to give everyone commit privileges. Regardless, here are the rules we'll be observing:

1. Respect others.
2. Respect others's work.
3. Respect the group roles and hierarchy.
4. Respect the project and goals.
5. Respect everyone's time—including your own.
