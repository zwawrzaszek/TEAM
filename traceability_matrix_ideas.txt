Creating a traceability matrix that is easy to read without using a table is going to be a bit of a challenge. Here are some ideas.

From: https://www.guru99.com/traceability-matrix.html

Req. ID		Req. Descr.    	Applicable Role			Testcase ID   	Testcase Descr.		Status			Tested by        

FR1.1		Login to the    User					TC01			Enter username		TC01-Pass       AM
			application								TC02			Enter password		TC02-Fail		SB		

[The problem with this one is that we would have to keep the "table" neat using just tabs, and when you need to wrap your text into a second row it will shift everything down. That being said, I think something like this would be the most visual and easy to follow solution.]

===
**Req. No**: FR1.1
**Req. Descr.**: Login to the application
**Testcase ID**: TC01, TC02
**Status**:TC01-Pass, TC02-Fail

[Formatting this will be easier, on a large project it may become difficult to follow but it would probably be ok for us.]

===
		Req. FR1.1	Req. FR1.2	Req. BR1.1	Req BR2.1	
TC01	pass		NA						pass
TC02	fail		fail		pass	

[This format would require grouping the requirements by for example business requirement, or functional requirement, and having a clear definition somewhere explaining what each requirement is and what the test cases were.]
